## Repository python_tools

### Indroduction

<p align="justify">In this repository I will put a collection of scripts that I need in my daily work. Personally, I like to use ANSI codes or ASCII characters and Unicode characters. Using ASCII characters is old style. New style is the use of Unicode characters.</p>

### Development Environment

<p align="justify">Development is done on various Linux installations based on Debian distributions. In general, I do not use other operating systems on desktop computers or laptops. The systems I use are based on AMD and ARM architecture. As a programming language, I prefer to use Bash or Python. Python is used in the current version 3. For Tezos developments mainly PyTezos from PyPi is used. The verification of the Python code is done with Pylint.</p>
